                            <h4>3. RESTRICTIONS</h4>
                            <p>The Services are available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older, but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it. You may not use the Services to purchase alcohol products unless you and the recipient meet the minimum age requirements under applicable state or provincial laws and present a valid photo identification verifying your age at the time you pick up or receive delivery of your order.</p>

                            <p>Restaurants are expressly prohibited from selling or offering for sale to any customer, regardless of age, any tobacco or nicotine products including, but not limited to, cigarettes and e-cigarettes. You may not attempt to sell or purchase any such products using our Services. We reserve the right to immediately deny you access to our Services, without notice, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated or attempted to violate this policy. For the avoidance of doubt, even if You are of legal age to purchase tobacco products in your jurisdiction, doing so or attempting to do so through our Platform is expressly prohibited.<p>

                            <p>BigHoller enforces a maximum order amount of $4,000 per order. BigHoller reserves the right to modify this maximum at any time without notice.</p>

                            <h4>4. PAYMENT; REFUNDS</h4>
                            <p>You pay for our product via the Services. You agree that BigHoller may immediately authorize your credit card (or other approved facility) for payment for any order made under your Password (as defined below) or via a payment form you transmitted to us.<p>
                            
                            <p>As set forth more fully in Section 6 below, you must keep your Password strictly confidential. You are responsible for all activities and charges that occur under your Password or account. Your liability for such charges shall continue after termination of this Agreement.</p>

                            <p>If you have a question about a transaction on your credit card statement, please use the "Contact Us" section of the Website to contact customer service.</p>

                            <p>If you are dissatisfied with our services, you may be entitled to a refund, outside of the setup fee, if it is within the first 30 days of signing up. Please bring any problems to our attention immediately. We will try our best to resolve all issues to your satisfaction. Please keep in mind that online ordering comes with a cost. Depending upon the nature of the dispute, we do reserve the right to refuse a refund.</p>

                            <p>If you are an existing customer there are no partial refunds for stopping service in the middle of a month or year or two year period. For those signing up year by year or every two years, since you are getting a discount over the monthly rate, you must cancel your service within 30 days prior to your renewal. If you decide after being charged an annual renewal you want to quit, we will only consider a refund if it was done within 10 days of the renewal and our service did not process any online orders for you during the renewal period. If orders were processed, no refund will be given</p>

                            <h4>5. DELIVERIES</h4>
                            <p>In the United States only, we use third-party delivery companies to deliver your orders. If you are not at the delivery location when your order arrives, the delivery person will leave the package for you at your door, or, if applicable, with the doorman or at the delivery center, and you will be charged the applicable fee for the order. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the delivery. In the case of inclement weather, your order will be delivered as soon as reasonably possible when the conditions permit.</p>

                            <p>BIGHOLLER, NOT BEING THE DELIVERY SERVICE OR ITS AGENT, MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE DELIVERY SERVICES AND DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH WARRANTIES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE EXIST.</p>

                            <h4>6. SIGN-IN NAME, PASSWORD, UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS</h4>
                            <p>During the registration process for Registered Users, we will ask you to create an account, which includes a unique sign-in name ("Sign-In Name"), password ("Password"), and perhaps certain additional information that will assist in authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future ("Unique Identifiers"). When creating your account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. Each Sign-In Name and corresponding Password can be used by only one Registered User. You are responsible for the confidentiality and use of your Sign-In Name, Password, and Unique Identifiers. You will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name, or change any Unique Identifier. We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In Name, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason. Alternatively, if you do not setup an account to sign into, BigHoller will setup an account on your behalf and manage this account on your behalf, which is the same as you accessing your own account.</p>

                            <p>In the event of any failure of any of the Apps to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple or Google, and Apple or Google will refund the purchase price, if any, for the applicable App to you and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple or Google will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App. As between BigHoller and Apple or Google, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of BigHoller.</p>

                            <h4>17. BINDING ARBITRATION</h4>
                            <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Services or any other products or services provided by us (each, a "Dispute"), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court in Essex County, New Jersey may enforce the arbitrator's award. The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if applicable, or otherwise pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the "JAMS Rules"). Such disputes will be resolved by the arbitrator as determined under the JAMS Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in Essex County, New Jersey. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. In addition, we may bring an action for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
                            
                            <h4>19. MISCELLANEOUS</h4>
